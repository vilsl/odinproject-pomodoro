# pomodoro.js
A simple online pomodoro timer that let's the user customize intervals and duration. Supports desktop notifications for break time and work time. Originally homework from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project). 

## How to use it
The timer can be found online [here](https://vilsl.github.io/odinproject-pomodoro/).

## Built with
Just standard Javascript.

## Disclaimer
It is not completely accurate, and likely has more than a few undiscovered bugs. I wouldn't recommend using it as your primary timer.
